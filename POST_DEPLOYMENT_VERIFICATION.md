# Post-Deployment Verification Guide

Now that your environment variables have been added to Vercel, follow these steps to verify everything is working correctly.

## üöÄ Immediate Steps

### 1. Trigger a New Deployment
Since environment variables were just added, you need to trigger a new deployment for them to take effect:

\`\`\`bash
# Option 1: Push a small change
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deployment for env vars"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
# Go to Vercel Dashboard > Deployments > Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
\`\`\`

### 2. Access the Verification Page
Once the new deployment is complete:
1. Go to your preview URL
2. Navigate to `/verify-setup` (or use the link in the footer)
3. Check the environment variable status

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Environment Variables Show as "Missing"
**Solution:**
1. Verify variables are set in Vercel Dashboard
2. Ensure they're enabled for "Preview" environment
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation

### Issue: Google Sheets Test Fails
**Possible Causes:**
- Service account doesn't have access to the spreadsheet
- Private key format is incorrect
- Spreadsheet ID is wrong
- Wrong service account email

**Solution:**
1. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email: sheets-integration@children-of-christ-forms.iam.gserviceaccount.com
2. Give it "Editor" permissions
3. Verify the private key includes `\n` line breaks
4. Double-check the spreadsheet ID from the URL
5. Ensure the client email environment variable matches exactly: sheets-integration@children-of-christ-forms.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### Issue: Forms Submit but No Data in Sheets
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the spreadsheet has "Donations" and "Applications" sheets
3. Test the Google Sheets connection first
4. Check Vercel function logs for errors

## üìä Testing Procedure

### 1. Environment Check
\`\`\`bash
# Visit your preview URL
https://your-preview-url.vercel.app/verify-setup

# Check that all environment variables show as "configured"
\`\`\`

### 2. Google Sheets Test
\`\`\`bash
# Click "Test Google Sheets Connection"
# Should see: "Google Sheets integration is working correctly"
\`\`\`

\`\`\`

### 4. Data Verification
\`\`\`bash
# Check your Google Spreadsheet
# Should see new rows in "Donations" and "Applications" sheets

\`\`\`

## üîß Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Deployment Status
\`\`\`bash
# In Vercel Dashboard

4. Check "Function Logs" for runtime errors
\`\`\`

### Test Locally (if needed)
\`\`\`bash
# Pull latest environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local

# Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/verify-setup
\`\`\`

### Force Redeploy
\`\`\`bash
# If environment variables aren't taking effect

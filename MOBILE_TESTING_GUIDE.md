## Maintaining Mobile Responsiveness

### When Adding New Features
1. Start with mobile design first
2. Test on at least 3 different screen sizes
3. Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly
4. Optimize new images for mobile

### CSS Best Practices
1. Use relative units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed pixels
2. Implement responsive typography with clamp()
3. Use flexbox and grid for layouts
4. Test media queries thoroughly

### Performance Considerations
1. Lazy load images below the fold
2. Minimize JavaScript execution time
3. Keep bundle sizes small
4. Use appropriate image formats (WebP when possible)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Overflow Issues
- Check for elements with fixed widths
- Use `overflow-x: hidden` cautiously
- Ensure images have `max-width: 100%`

### Touch Target Problems
- Increase padding on interactive elements
- Add margin between clickable items
- Use DevTools to verify element dimensions

### Text Readability Issues
- Increase font size (minimum 16px)
- Improve color contrast
- Add proper line height (1.5x font size)
- Test with screen readers

### Performance Problems
- Reduce image sizes

- Implement code splitting
- Use performance monitoring tools

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure proper focus states for keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Implement proper ARIA attributes

## Regular Testing Schedule

- Test after every major update
- Monthly comprehensive testing on real devices
- Quarterly performance audits
- Annual full accessibility review

By following this guide, you'll ensure the Children of Christ website remains fully functional and user-friendly across all devices and screen sizes.
